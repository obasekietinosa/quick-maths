# quick-maths
Wrote this game after my wife showed me an instagram reel of children in a classroom being shown several numbers in quick succession and then saying the sum of these numbers. She's really good with numbers and was able to get the sums done (I could never!) so I've built this to see what the longest succession of numbers she correctly gets is.
